title: 'Introduction'
description: Eclipse is a set of handcrafted, production-ready components for SaaS marketing sites, designed by Makeswift. Taking inspiration from the sites of top SaaS products, such as Linear and Vercel, Eclipse is defined by a dark aesthetic and using subtle glows and light to guide visitors. Like these beloved sites, Eclipse implements a minimal design and color palette to keep focus on your product screenshots.

Out of the box, Eclipse provides several style options to choose from to help visualize how different brands can adapt these components. You'll also find section and page templates composed of Eclipse components, text, and images to provide beautiful, easy-to-use layouts for you to include in your site. Eclipse is built with performance and extensibility as top priorities, optimized to work with minimal dependencies within a Next.js stack.

## Aesthetic

Eclipse uses dark colors for it's primary background. It also uses brighter primary and accent colors in key areas to add contrast and convey interactivity. Like it's name suggests, these brighter colors are often displayed as glowing highlights and backgrounds to create ambiance and depth. These glowing elements are used to designate active elements, like tabs, as well as to highlight parts of a component, such as a preferred pricing card.

Containers and cards in Eclipse use subtle, translucent backgrounds that blur content placed behind them, creating a dark, frosted effect. This creates more depth and allows for containers to interact with glows and background elements.

Eclipse's typography is clean and modern primarily using sans-serif fonts. Headings can be displayed in a thinner weight to convey a sleeker look, or use heavier weights for a more bold approach.

## Components

We know great product teams spend countless hours getting every pixel just right. We wanted to make sure every component built for Eclipse reflected the same level of craftsmanship. Eclipse comes with standard primitives such as buttons and cards, but with an extra layer of polish and interactivity that many UI libraries don't provide.

We've included more dynamic components such as accordions and tabs you would expect in a marketing site toolkit. But to go the extra mile, we've also created more customized components such as auto-scrolling logo marquees, touch-enabled carousels, and animated WebGL backgrounds to elevate your website's content. All components are built to be performant across all devices, as well as accessible for all visitors.

## Animations

Eclipse contains thoughtful animations and interactions for each of it's components. For many of it's active glow effects, the animations are intentionally slowed down to give a feeling of calm and illumination. You'll also find options to add animated glowing borders on buttons and containers adding more visibility to more important content. Some of our more dynamic components, such as the Lava Lamp background, provide interactive backgrounds visitors can engage with, adding more wonder to your site.
