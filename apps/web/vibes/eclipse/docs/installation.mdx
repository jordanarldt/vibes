description: How to start using Eclipse in your project.

Eclipse and it's components are built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and styled using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). We reccomend using these same technologies in your project to get the most out of Eclipse.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Add dependencies

    ```bash
    npm install -D tailwindcss-animate @tailwindcss/container-queries
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Update `tailwind.config.ts`

    <TailwindConfig />

  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Add style variables

    Eclipse has 2 styles to choose from. Styles are a collection of design tokens which apply to all components in this VIBE. Styles can also be customized to represent your own brand.

    Follow the [aquamarine](/docs/eclipse/aquamarine) or [magenta](/docs/eclipse/magenta) installation instructions to start using these styles.
